design pattern examples in php
------------------------------

all the examples code are here for better understanding design pattern using php.there are two files in every folder
for a particular design pattern named problem.php and solution.php. problem.php exhibits the problem and solution.php
contains solution code suggested by that particular pattern.

there is no explanation for the pattern or examples. to learn design pattern go to http://architecture.howtocode.com.bd/index.html .

as i'm a newbie you may find errors in the code. if you do feel free to correct it by pull request.
